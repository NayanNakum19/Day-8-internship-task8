# 🧠 Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates how to apply **unsupervised learning** with **K-Means Clustering** to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. It also includes techniques such as the **Elbow Method**, **Silhouette Score**, and optional **PCA** for visualization.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **File**: `Mall_Customers.csv`
- **Features Used**:
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1-100)

---

## 🚀 Objective

To group customers into meaningful clusters to help businesses understand purchasing behavior and target the right audience.

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. **Load and explore** the dataset.
2. **Visualize** customer distribution (Annual Income vs Spending Score).
3. **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. **K-Means Clustering** to group customers.
5. **Color-coded cluster visualization**.
6. **Evaluate using Silhouette Score**.
7. **PCA (optional)** to reduce dimensionality and visualize clusters in 2D.

---

## 📊 Output Metrics

- **Inertia**: Used in Elbow Method to find optimal `K`.
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures cluster quality (higher is better).

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Elbow Curve
- Cluster Scatter Plot
- PCA Cluster Visualization (2D)
